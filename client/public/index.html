      One advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN:

      Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting
      another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your
      site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure
      that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server
      closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
